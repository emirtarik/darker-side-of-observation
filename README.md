## Introduction

Publicizing actions is a standard policy tool to promote prosocial behavior. This project shows that the efficacy of exposing individuals to social stigma crucially depends on whether the observers themselves faced the same moral dilemma before judging (active observers), a common feature in many environments. The study demonstrates that active observation polarizes evaluations: observers who acted prosocially judge more harshly selfish behavior and commend prosocial acts more highly. It also highlights that active observation decreases the quality of evaluations as observers ignore information to exploit moral wiggle room.

## Requirements

The following software and packages are required to run this project:

- Python 3.x
- Stata 15 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib
  - nbformat
  - nbconvert
  - scikit-learn

## Setup

To set up the environment to run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/darker-side-of-observation.git
   cd darker-side-of-observation
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages (this step can also be skipped as `master.py` automatically installs all requirements):
   
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure Stata is installed and added to your system's PATH.

4. Adjust the directories in the `config.json` file as per your system configuration:

   ```
   {
     "main_path": "/path/to/your/main/directory",
     "data_path": "/path/to/your/data/directory",
     "code1_path": "/path/to/your/code1/directory",
     "code2_path": "/path/to/your/code2/directory",
     "stata_path": "/path/to/your/stata/executable"
   }
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the `master.py` script which sequentially performs data cleaning, statistical modeling, and result visualization. Please refer to the `master.py` script for detailed steps.

```
   python master.py
```

## Files

- `master.py`: Main script to run the entire project workflow.
- `01_clean.do`: Stata script for cleaning the raw data.
- `02_methods.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for applying statistical methods and building models.
- `02_analysis.do`: Stata script for generating plots and tables used in the final analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `config.json`: Configuration file specifying directory paths.

## Results

The findings suggest that active observation leads to more polarized evaluations compared to passive observation. Active observers who act prosocially judge selfish behavior more harshly and commend prosocial acts more highly.
